-- fakeroute v0.2 --

Install Instructions:

tar zxvf fakeroute-0.2.tar.gz
cd fakeroute-0.2
./configure
make
make install

Usage:

To use fakeroute, you must define a route file with your fake route.  The file
should be a newline separated list of dotted quad IP addresses with your IP 
address last.  For example, 10.0.0.34 could have a route.conf that looks like:

216.102.187.130
165.87.161.74
4.24.4.146
4.0.1.122
198.137.241.43
198.116.142.34
63.199.8.242

...be careful not to include any leading or trailing blank newlines.
Optionally, you could include any IP address last that you wish to be the
destination of the remote traceroute.  The above route will stop at:
"adsl-63-199-8-242.carcionelaw.com" as if it were the traceroute destination:

To run, become root, and simply execute "fakeroute -f <route_file>".

To test your configuration, just traceroute to localhost.

Bugs:

Currently, fakeroute only works for UDP-based (ie: default unix) traceroute.  
It does not work for unix traceroute with the -I option, or windows tracert.
Hopefully support for ICMP-based traceroute will come in a later version.
